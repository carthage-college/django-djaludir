The attributes we use in LDAP are:

carthageDob - date of birth
carthageFacultyStatus - populated with an A if the user is a faculty member
carthageStaffStatus - populated with an A if the user is a staff member
carthageStudentStatus - populated with an A if the user is a student
carthageNameID - ID#
carthageSSN - social security number (only last four digits, all others are Xs)
cn = username
givenName  = First Name
sn = Last Name
mail = e-mail address

To have the carthage specific attributes, a user must have an objectClass of carthageUser.

Also note the special userPassword attribute. This is an attribute that can only be written to or deleted, never read from. You can change a password with LDAP by first doing a delete on the userPassword with a value of the old password, and then an add with the new password-something like this PHP:

$result=$ldap->modify($dn
      changes => [
            delete => [ userPassword => "$oldpass"],
            add => [userPassword => "$newpass"],
      ]
      );

Containers

In the Novell ecosystem, "containers" are the same as the Organizational Unit we see in OpenLDAP world: that is, the "ou" in the LDAP schema.

Carthage have the following containers:

Faculty
Staff
Students
Former Students
TrustedOutsiders

see below for their corresponding attributes.

The attributes we use in LDAP
carthageDob - date of birth
carthageFacultyStatus - populated with an A if the user is a faculty member
carthageStaffStatus - populated with an A if the user is a staff member
carthageStudentStatus - populated with an A if the user is a student
carthageFormerStudentStatus - populated with an A if the user is a alumni
carthageOtherStatus - populated with an A if the user a "Trusted Outsider"
carthageNameID - ID#
carthageSSN - social security number (only last four digits, all others are Xs)
cn = username
givenName  = First Name
sn = Last Name
mail = e-mail address
userPassword = [see below]

To have the carthage specific attributes, a user must have an objectClass of carthageUser.

userPassword

In Novell, you can't really see this value. You can only create it and update it. There is some magic that takes place when you create a password, wherein the value is encrypted. The same magic takes care of comparing values during authentication.

This is an attribute that can only be written to or deleted, never read from. You can change a password with LDAP by first doing a delete on the userPassword with a value of the old password, and then an add with the new password-something like this PHP:

$result=$ldap->modify($dn
    changes => [
        delete => [ userPassword => "$oldpass"],
        add => [userPassword => "$newpass"],
    ]
);

Trees

CAMPUS
LDAP
META

These trees also correspond to the servers in our pool. For example, we use the CAMPUS tree for authentication for most web applications, and corresponds to the hendrix.carthage.edu server. For the alumni directory, since we are creating LDAP users, we have to use the LDAP tree, which corresponds to the george.carthage.edu server.

Chapuzas
On johann.carthage.edu, Ron dumps CSV files that Novell can import into the LDAP store. Those files live in:
/home/IBM/Desktop/import/input
You set up the import mechanism through the Novell eDirectory web interface.
